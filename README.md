### Hello there ðŸ‘‹.
**Do you know Viktor Navorski for the movie " The Terminal"?** 

A foreigner in a strange land, trying to make sense of a world around him, though he didn't give up untill he reach to his goal.

Just like Viktor, I'm starting from scratch and learning the ropes of programming one step at a time. Sure, right now I'm a lost traveler, wandering around the airport of coding trying to find my way. But I'm on a mission to achieve my goal 

with my trusty keyboard and a whole lot of persistence. So, let's buckle up, clear for takeoff, and get ready to explore the vast and exciting world of programming!"
