### Hello there 👋.
<p align="center"> Do you know Viktor Navorski from the movie " The Terminal"? </p>

A foreigner in a strange land, trying to make sense of a world he doesn't understand. Despite the overwhelming odds he was determined to pursue his dream.

Just like Viktor, I'm starting from scratch and learning the ropes of programming one step at a time. Sure, at this point I'm a lost traveler looking for my way around the programming airport. But I'm on a mission to succeed in my quest no matter the obstacles in my way.

Would you like to be part of my journey?! Please fasten your seatbelts, and prepare for takeoff ✈️.
